Now, it's important that you understand that you're here right now for a reason.

You snuck into Room 1307 at 1:00 AM tonight in order to attempt to steal an answer key off of the professor's computer, in an attempt to break the sacred rules of test-taking and gain an unfair advantage during the upcoming Impressionism unit exam. 
       
People like you don't have enough respect for people like me. The ones that have to work hard without an advantage. The people that have to try in order to succeed because there is no other option. 
       
To feel a sense of accomplishment from a cheated victory is to cease to be human. It is my mission to... correct... the actions of kids like you, and see to it that they are not repeated.

It may start with cheating on a test, but when you let yourself slip in the way of standards there's no going back. When you're in a group that enables it, it gets worse. The most potent example I can think of is those god-awful painters from back in the day. Them and that sycophantic photo kid who was so desperate to impress them.

What's your major anyway? I could make a guess based on your behavior, but in the interest of being fair and balanced I'll hear you out.
