Anyway, my parents weren't against art school but they were against fiber arts. It's a weird problem to have, most people either have parents that accept art as a career or don't, but when your parents are artists themselves they have to find more unique ways to disapprove of your career choices.

My dad was an illustrator and my mom was a graphic designer. Both worked for big companies. They always assumed I'd do something artistic, but it had to be "useful." Something you could get hired for. Now, they were somewhat correct that no one hires knitters, but they were completely blind to the possibilities of self employment these days!
        
The blog started as a hobby, but it actually started getting a bit popular. It's a niche group, so while most people wouldn't expect a knitting blog to get traction, when the knitters find you they don't let you go! I started doing some commissions and felt like I could make it a business, but I hate to admit that while it was a start it probably wasn't quite there yet. 
        
Parents told me I should be more realistic about my goals and go with something I could get hired for. I was so upset at the idea that I couldn't spend my life doing the only thing I'm really good at that I didn't really put much stock in picking a major out of spite. My dad taught me a decent amount of drawing and painting when I was younger and I just went with the one I hated less I suppose...&
