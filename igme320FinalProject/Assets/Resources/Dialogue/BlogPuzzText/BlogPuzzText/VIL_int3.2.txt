The students threatening to expose me had me do all sorts of dirty work for them. But the worst of all, they made me steal answers to a bunch of their upcoming tests. It was such a pain, sneaking into the school at night, making sure not to get spotted by any security guards. But you would know about all that already, you little thief!&

Regardless, that was the reason I snagged you and brought you to this warehouse. Becuase you were as greedy as them, eventually you'll suffer the same fate I did at the hands of your fellow painting majors. At least you were good enough to not force someone else into stealing them for you.&
