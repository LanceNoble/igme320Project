The students threatening to expose me forced me to do all sorts of dirty work for them. The worst of it all was when they made me steal answers to a bunch of their upcoming tests. It was such a pain, sneaking into the school at night, making sure not to get spotted by any security guards. But you would know about all that already, you little thief!

Regardless, that was the reason I snagged you and brought you to this warehouse. Because you were as greedy as them, eventually you'll suffer the same fate I did at the hands of your fellow painting majors. At least you were good enough to not force someone else into stealing the answers for you.
