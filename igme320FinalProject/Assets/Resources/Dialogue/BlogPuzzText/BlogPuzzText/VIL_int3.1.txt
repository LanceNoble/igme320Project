Eventually, cyberbullying wasn't enough to satisfy them. I began attracting their attention around the school, they would call me names as I walked past, they threw things at me in class, and some would even sabotage my assignments... it truly was unbearable.

A group of them even threatened to tell my parents about my blog, and I knew if they found out that my knitting days would soon be over. I begged them not to reveal my secret, and that is when they beagn to blackmail me.
