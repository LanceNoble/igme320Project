Any hoo, where did we leave off? Oh right, I chose painting as my major that way my parents wouldn't continue to argue with me about it. I had the skills required to get the degree, but motiviation was a whole different problem. I wasn't having any fun with my projects, and every class was dreadfully boring. Art history is a brain killer that's for sure.&

I turned my distaste with school into new hope by starting a blog, which originally was only a hobby, but it actually started getting a bit popular. It's a niche group, so while most people wouldn't expect a knitting blog to get traction, when the knitters find you they don't let you go! I started doing some commissions and felt like I could make it a business, but I hate to admit that while it was a start it probably wasn't quite there yet.&
