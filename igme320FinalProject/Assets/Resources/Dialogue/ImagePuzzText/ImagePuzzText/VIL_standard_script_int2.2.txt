Enough with the distractions, let's get back to my evil brooding!! While comissions for the blog weren't very high, I still found it to be an enjoyable safe place. It was somewhere I could be myself without any judgement, truly the internet is a beautiful place!&

Unfortunately, that peace of mind did not last long as eventually my blog was discovered by my new school bullies. They began writing rude comments on all of my posts, and telling me that my work wasn't real art! Eventually, this treatment moved from solely online into the classrooms and halls at my school, and I was faced with ridicule everywhere I went. This treatment truly discouraged me, and eventually I gave up on my blog altogether. I decided to log out of it permentally by exiting the site and ripping up the piece of paper with the password written on it so I would never remember what it was!&
