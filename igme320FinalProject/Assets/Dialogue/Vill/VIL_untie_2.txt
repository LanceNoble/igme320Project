Painting's such a cliche... people have been innovating there since caves. Nothing new to discover anymore.

Nothing like knitting!
        
Unlimited possibilities in 3 dimensions, so many knots yet to be discovered... you get to make something REAL instead of just replicating it on paper! There's no other feeling like it!
        
You know, I discovered a knot when I was younger! It was so simple too! Two strings that go 13421! It's got a strong hold against pressure and it works so well for sewing!&
        
I got a minor online presence for that! I had a blog and everything! But I went to college for painting still. My family didn't think there were any jobs in crafts but I wanted to go to an art school regardless. And when I got here it turns out it was so much worse than I thought!&

That reminds me actually...&
